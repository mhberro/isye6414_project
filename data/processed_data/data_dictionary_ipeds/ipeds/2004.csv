HD2004,INSTCAT,"Institutional category

This indicator was derived using the level of offerings reported on the 2004-05 Institutional Characteristics (IC) component and the number and level of awards that were reported on the 2003-04 Completions (C) component.

The following is the specific derivation:

1) Degree-granting, graduate with no undergraduate degrees - These institutions offer either a Master's degree (LEVEL7), Doctor's degree (LEVEL9) or a First-professional degree (LEVEL10) and do not offer a Bachelor's degree (LEVEL5) or an Associate's degree (LEVEL3). 

2) Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above - These institutions offer a bachelor's degree (LEVEL5). Also, the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded is greater than 50 percent. (IC and C)

3) Degree-granting, other baccalaureate granting - These institutions offer a bachelor's degree (LEVEL5). Also,  the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded must be less than or equal to 50 percent.(IC and C)

Bachelor's  degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree awarded is the sum of: 
 Bachelor's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=5,MAJORNUM=1)
 Postbaccalaureate certificates (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=6,MAJORNUM=1)
 Master's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=7,MAJORNUM=1)
 Post-master's certificates (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=8,MAJORNUM=1)
 Doctor's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=9,MAJORNUM=1)
 First-professional degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=10,MAJORNUM=1)
 First-professional certificates (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=11,MAJORNUM=1)

Total degrees and certificates is the sum of:
 Bachelor degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelors degree as defined above and 
 Associate's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=3,MAJORNUM=1)
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least two but less-than four academic years (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=4,MAJORNUM=1).
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least one but less-than two academic years (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=2,MAJORNUM=1); 
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=1,MAJORNUM=1) 

4) Degree-granting,  Associate's and certificates - Institutions offer an Associate's degree (LEVEL3) and may offer other postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year (LEVEL1); at least one but less-than two academic years (LEVEL2); at least two but less-than four academic years (LEVEL4). (IC)

5) Nondegree-granting, above the baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's (LEVEL3), Bachelor's (LEVEL5), Master's (LEVEL7), Doctor's (LEVEL9) or First-professional (LEVEL10) degrees, but offer either Postbaccaulaureate (LEVEL6), Post-master's (LEVEL8) or First-professional (LEVEL11) certificates. (IC)

6) Nondegree-granting, sub-baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's (LEVEL3), Bachelor's (LEVEL5), Master's (LEVEL7), Doctor's (LEVEL9),  or  First-professional(LEVEL10) degrees, or certificates above the baccalaureate level(LEVEL6,LEVEL8 and LEVEL11). They do offer postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year (LEVEL1); at least one but less than two academic years (LEVEL2); or at least two but less than four academic years.(LEVEL4) (IC)

All inactive institutions (CYACTIVE in (2,3)) and administrative units (Sector=0) were coded as not applicable. Any institution that did not respond to the 2004-05 Institutional Characteristics component or the 2003-04 Completions component were coded as not reported or could not derive. These were all NonTitle IV institutions.

Additional notes on classifying Degree-granting primarily baccalaureate or above and other baccalaureate granting:

Degree-granting institutions whose completions data are reported with their parent institution were assigned the same code as the parent institution.
 
New degree-granting institutions that offer a bachelor's degree, but have not yet awarded bachelor degrees in academic year 2003-04 were assigned as follows:

  If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above (indicating the level was offered) and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above.
  
  If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's degree and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, other baccalaureate granting.
  
  For institutions that reported zeros for both bachelor's degrees or above and for levels below the bachelor's the number of programs (CIP codes) by level was used to determine the primary classification. If the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates at the bachelor's level or above was greater than the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates less than the baccalaureate, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, primarily bachelor's or above.  If the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates at the bachelor's level or above was less than the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates less than the baccalaureate, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, other baccalaureate granting.
