HD2005,CONTROL,"A classification of whether an institution is operated by publicly elected or appointed officials or by privately elected or appointed officials and derives its major source of funds from private sources.

Public institution - An educational institution whose programs and activities are operated by publicly elected or appointed school officials and which is supported primarily by public funds. 

Private not-for-profit institution - A private institution in which the individual(s) or agency in control receives no compensation, other than wages, rent, or other expenses for the assumption of risk. These include both independent not-for-profit schools and those affiliated with a religious organization. 

Private for-profit institution - A private institution in which the individual(s) or agency in control receives compensation other than wages, rent, or other expenses for the assumption of risk. 



"
HD2005,HOSPITAL,"A code to indicate whether the institution has hospital.

This variable was derived using Finance data.

If institution reported either revenues from Sales and services of hospitals GASB, hospital revenues (FASB), or expenses for hospital services (GASB or FASB) an institution was determined to have a hospital.  See glossary terms below.


Sales and services of hospitals (revenues) F1B06-GASB.  Revenues (net of discounts, allowances, and provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable) generated by hospitals from daily patient, special and other services. Revenues of health clinics that are part of a hospital should be included in this category, unless such clinics are part of the student health services program. 

Hospitals (revenues) F2D13-FASB.  Revenues generated by a hospital operated by the postsecondary institution. Includes gifts, grants, appropriations, research revenues, endowment income, and revenues of health clinics that are part of the hospital unless such clinics are part of the student health services program. Sales and service revenues are included net of patient contractual allowances. Revenues associated with the medical school are included elsewhere. Also includes all amounts appropriated by governments (federal, state, local) for the operation of hospitals. 

Hospital services (F1C121-GASB, F2E091-FASB).  Expenses associated with a hospital operated by the postsecondary institution (but not as a component unit) and reported as a part of the institution. This classification includes nursing expenses, other professional services, general services, administrative services, and fiscal services. Also included are information technology expenses, actual or allocated costs for operation and maintenance of plant, and depreciation related to hospital capital assets. FASB institutions also charge or allocate interest expense to hospitals.

HD2005,INSTCAT,"Institutional category

This indicator was derived using the level of offerings reported on the 2005-06 Institutional Characteristics (IC) component and the number and level of awards that were reported on the 2004-05 Completions (C) component.

The following is the specific derivation:

1) Degree-granting, graduate with no undergraduate degrees - These institutions offer either a Master's degree (LEVEL7), Doctor's degree (LEVEL9) or a First-professional degree (LEVEL10) and do not offer a Bachelor's degree (LEVEL5) or an Associate's degree (LEVEL3). 

2) Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above - These institutions offer a bachelor's degree (LEVEL5). Also, the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded is greater than 50 percent. (IC and C)

3) Degree-granting, other baccalaureate granting - These institutions offer a bachelor's degree (LEVEL5). Also,  the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded must be less than or equal to 50 percent.(IC and C)

Bachelor's  degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree awarded is the sum of: 
 Bachelor's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=5,MAJORNUM=1)
 Postbaccalaureate certificates (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=6,MAJORNUM=1)
 Master's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=7,MAJORNUM=1)
 Post-master's certificates (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=8,MAJORNUM=1)
 Doctor's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=9,MAJORNUM=1)
 First-professional degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=10,MAJORNUM=1)
 First-professional certificates (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=11,MAJORNUM=1)

Total degrees and certificates is the sum of:
 Bachelor degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelors degree as defined above and 
 Associate's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=3,MAJORNUM=1)
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least two but less-than four academic years (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=4,MAJORNUM=1).
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least one but less-than two academic years (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=2,MAJORNUM=1); 
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=1,MAJORNUM=1) 

4) Degree-granting,  Associate's and certificates - Institutions offer an Associate's degree (LEVEL3) and may offer other postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year (LEVEL1); at least one but less-than two academic years (LEVEL2); at least two but less-than four academic years (LEVEL4). (IC)

5) Nondegree-granting, above the baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's (LEVEL3), Bachelor's (LEVEL5), Master's (LEVEL7), Doctor's (LEVEL9) or First-professional (LEVEL10) degrees, but offer either Postbaccaulaureate (LEVEL6), Post-master's (LEVEL8) or First-professional (LEVEL11) certificates. (IC)

6) Nondegree-granting, sub-baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's (LEVEL3), Bachelor's (LEVEL5), Master's (LEVEL7), Doctor's (LEVEL9),  or  First-professional(LEVEL10) degrees, or certificates above the baccalaureate level(LEVEL6,LEVEL8 and LEVEL11). They do offer postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year (LEVEL1); at least one but less than two academic years (LEVEL2); or at least two but less than four academic years.(LEVEL4) (IC)

All inactive institutions (CYACTIVE in (2,3)) and administrative units (Sector=0) were coded as not applicable. Any institution that did not respond to the 2005-06 Institutional Characteristics component or the 2004-05 Completions component were coded as not reported or could not derive. These were all NonTitle IV institutions.

Additional notes on classifying Degree-granting primarily baccalaureate or above and other baccalaureate granting:

Degree-granting institutions whose completions data are reported with their parent institution were assigned the same code as the parent institution.
 
New degree-granting institutions that offer a bachelor's degree, but have not yet awarded bachelor degrees in academic year 2004-05 were assigned as follows:

  If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above (indicating the level was offered) and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above.
  
  If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's degree and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, other baccalaureate granting.
  
  For institutions that reported zeros for both bachelor's degrees or above and for levels below the bachelor's the number of programs (CIP codes) by level was used to determine the primary classification. If the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates at the bachelor's level or above was greater than the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates less than the baccalaureate, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, primarily bachelor's or above.  If the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates at the bachelor's level or above was less than the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates less than the baccalaureate, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, other baccalaureate granting.

HD2005,CCIPUG,"Carnegie Classification 2005: Undergraduate Instructional Program

The instructional program classification is based on three pieces of information: the level of undergraduate degrees awarded (associate’s or bachelor’s), the proportion of bachelor’s degree majors in the arts and sciences and in professional fields, and the extent to which an institution awards graduate degrees in the same fields in which it awards undergraduate degrees.

The distinction between arts and sciences and professional undergraduate majors is one that has been made in the Classification since 1987 (but only for undergraduate colleges), and researchers and others in the higher education community have also made similar distinctions. We are extending and elaborating the previous analysis by (1) applying it to almost all baccalaureate-level institutions, (2) making finer distinctions along the arts & sciences – professions continuum, and (3) recognizing a “middle ground” where the two domains exist in relative balance with respect to graduating students’ major concentrations. 

A high concentration of majors in the arts and sciences is not the same as a liberal arts education, and we do not view any particular location on this continuum as the special province of liberal education. Examples of high-quality liberal education exist across the spectrum.

Some institutions enroll no graduate students. Others may have graduate programs that operate relatively independently of the undergraduate program (such as a law school). Still others offer graduate education in most or all fields where they have undergraduate programs. And of course, some institutions fall between these extremes. By examining the number of undergraduate fields in which we also see graduate degrees, we can locate institutions along this continuum of undergraduate-graduate “coexistence.” Departments that teach only undergraduates can differ in many ways from those that also train graduate students. Examples of such differences include faculty activities and instructional resources.

It is important to emphasize that we do not view these continua (arts & sciences – professions or graduate coexistence) as signifying gradations in value or quality.
The categories are as follows:

Assoc: Associate’s. According to the degree data, these institutions awarded associate’s degrees but no bachelor’s degrees.

Assoc-Dom: Associate’s Dominant. These institutions awarded both associate’s and bachelor’s degrees, but the majority of degrees awarded were at the associate’s level.

A&S-F/NGC: Arts & sciences focus, no graduate coexistence. According to the degree data, at least 80 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

A&S-F/SGC: Arts & sciences focus, some graduate coexistence. At least 80 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in some of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors (but less than half).

A&S-F/HGC: Arts & sciences focus, high graduate coexistence. At least 80 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

A&S+Prof/NGC: Arts & sciences plus professions, no graduate coexistence. According to the degree data, 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

A&S+Prof/SGC: Arts & sciences plus professions, some graduate coexistence. 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in some of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors (but less than half).

A&S+Prof/HGC: Arts & sciences plus professions, high graduate coexistence. 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Bal/NGC: Balanced arts & sciences/professions, no graduate coexistence. According to the degree data, bachelor’s degree majors were relatively balanced between arts and sciences and professional fields (41–59 percent in each), and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Bal/SGC: Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence. Bachelor’s degree majors were relatively balanced between arts and sciences and professional fields (41–59 percent in each), and graduate degrees were observed in some of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors (but less than half).

Bal/HGC: Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence. Bachelor’s degree majors were relatively balanced between arts and sciences and professional fields (41–59 percent in each), and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Prof+A&S/NGC: Professions plus arts & sciences, no graduate coexistence. According to the degree data, 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in professional fields (such as business, education, engineering, health, and social work), and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Prof+A&S/SGC: Professions plus arts & sciences, some graduate coexistence. 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in professional fields, and graduate degrees were observed in some of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors (but less than half).

HD2005,CCENRPRF,"Carnegie Classification 2005: Enrollment Profile Classification

By grouping institutions according to the mix of students enrolled at the undergraduate and graduate/professional levels, this classification provides a bird’s eye view of the student population. Exclusively undergraduate institutions are further broken down by level (two-year and four-year). For institutions with both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, institutions are grouped according to the distribution of full-time equivalent students across the two levels, giving an approximate measure of the student population’s “center of gravity.” As a result, it reflects important differences with respect to educational mission as well as institutional climate and culture—differences that can have implications for infrastructure, services, and resource allocation.

The categories are as follows:

ExU2: Exclusively undergraduate two-year. Fall enrollment data show only undergraduates enrolled, and at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

ExU4: Exclusively undergraduate four-year. Fall enrollment data show only undergraduates enrolled, at these bachelor’s granting institutions.

VHU: Very high undergraduate. Fall enrollment data show both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, with the latter group accounting for less than 10 percent of FTE* enrollment.

HU: High undergraduate. Fall enrollment data show both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, with the latter group accounting for at least 10–24 percent of FTE enrollment.

MU: Majority undergraduate. Fall enrollment data show both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, with the latter group accounting for 25–49 percent of FTE enrollment.

MGP: Majority graduate/professional. Fall enrollment data show both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, with the latter group accounting for at least half of FTE enrollment.

ExGP: Exclusively graduate/professional. Fall enrollment data show only graduate/professional students enrolled.

* FTE: Full-time equivalent enrollment was calculated as full-time plus one-third part-time.

Classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 and 2004. Institutions might be classified differently using a different timeframe.

HD2005,LANDGRNT,"Land Grant Institution

A land-grant college or university is an institution that has been designated by its state legislature or Congress to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. The original mission of these institutions, as set forth in the first Morrill Act, was to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies so that members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education. 

Over the years, land-grant status has implied several types of federal support. The first Morrill Act provided grants in the form of federal lands to each state for the establishment of a public institution to fulfill the act's provisions. At different times money was appropriated through legislation such as the second Morrill Act and the Bankhead-Jones Act, although the funding provisions of these acts are no longer in effect. Today, the Nelson Amendment to the Morrill Act provides a permanent annual appropriation of $50,000 per state and territory. 

A key component of the land-grant system is the agricultural experiment station program created by the Hatch Act of 1887. The Hatch Act authorized direct payment of federal grant funds to each state to establish an agricultural experiment station in connection with the land-grant institution there. The amount of this appropriation varies from year to year and is determined for each state through a formula based on the number of small farmers there. A major portion of the federal funds must be matched by the state. 

To disseminate information gleaned from the experiment stations' research, the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created a Cooperative Extension Service associated with each U.S. land-grant institution. This act authorized ongoing federal support for extension services, using a formula similar to the Hatch Act's to determine the amount of the appropriation. This act also requires that the states provide matching funds in order to receive the federal monies.


Passage of the First Morrill Act (1862) reflected a growing demand for agricultural and technical education in the United States. While a number of institutions had begun to expand upon the traditional classical curriculum, higher education was still widely unavailable to many agricultural and industrial workers. The Morrill Act was intended to provide a broad segment of the population with a practical education that had direct relevance to their daily lives.

The Second Morrill Act (1890) sought to extend access to higher education by providing additional endowments for all land-grants, but prohibiting distribution of money to states that made distinctions of race in admissions. However, states that provided a separate land-grant institution for blacks were eligible to receive the funds. The institutions that, as a result of this act, were founded or designated the land-grant for blacks in each of the then-segregated Southern states came to be known as ""the 1890 land-grants.""  Native American tribal colleges are sometimes called the ""1994 land-grants.""
