HD2006,CONTROL,"A classification of whether an institution is operated by publicly elected or appointed officials or by privately elected or appointed officials and derives its major source of funds from private sources.

Public institution - An educational institution whose programs and activities are operated by publicly elected or appointed school officials and which is supported primarily by public funds. 

Private not-for-profit institution - A private institution in which the individual(s) or agency in control receives no compensation, other than wages, rent, or other expenses for the assumption of risk. These include both independent not-for-profit schools and those affiliated with a religious organization. 

Private for-profit institution - A private institution in which the individual(s) or agency in control receives compensation other than wages, rent, or other expenses for the assumption of risk. 



"
HD2006,HOSPITAL,"A code to indicate whether the institution has hospital.

This variable was derived using Finance data.

If institution reported either revenues from Sales and services of hospitals GASB, hospital revenues (FASB), or expenses for hospital services (GASB or FASB) an institution was determined to have a hospital.  See glossary terms below.


Sales and services of hospitals (revenues) F1B06-GASB.  Revenues (net of discounts, allowances, and provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable) generated by hospitals from daily patient, special and other services. Revenues of health clinics that are part of a hospital should be included in this category, unless such clinics are part of the student health services program. 

Hospitals (revenues) F2D13-FASB.  Revenues generated by a hospital operated by the postsecondary institution. Includes gifts, grants, appropriations, research revenues, endowment income, and revenues of health clinics that are part of the hospital unless such clinics are part of the student health services program. Sales and service revenues are included net of patient contractual allowances. Revenues associated with the medical school are included elsewhere. Also includes all amounts appropriated by governments (federal, state, local) for the operation of hospitals. 

Hospital services (F1C121-GASB, F2E091-FASB).  Expenses associated with a hospital operated by the postsecondary institution (but not as a component unit) and reported as a part of the institution. This classification includes nursing expenses, other professional services, general services, administrative services, and fiscal services. Also included are information technology expenses, actual or allocated costs for operation and maintenance of plant, and depreciation related to hospital capital assets. FASB institutions also charge or allocate interest expense to hospitals.

HD2006,INSTCAT,"Institutional category

This indicator was derived using the level of offerings reported on the 2006-07 Institutional Characteristics (IC) component and the number and level of awards that were reported on the 2005-06 Completions (C) component.

The following is the specific derivation:

1) Degree-granting, graduate with no undergraduate degrees - These institutions offer either a Master's degree (LEVEL7), Doctor's degree (LEVEL9) or a First-professional degree (LEVEL10) and do not offer a Bachelor's degree (LEVEL5) or an Associate's degree (LEVEL3). 

2) Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above - These institutions offer a bachelor's degree (LEVEL5). Also, the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded is greater than 50 percent. (IC and C)

3) Degree-granting, other baccalaureate granting - These institutions offer a bachelor's degree (LEVEL5). Also,  the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded must be less than or equal to 50 percent.(IC and C)

Bachelor's  degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree awarded is the sum of: 
 Bachelor's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=5,MAJORNUM=1)
 Postbaccalaureate certificates (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=6,MAJORNUM=1)
 Master's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=7,MAJORNUM=1)
 Post-master's certificates (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=8,MAJORNUM=1)
 Doctor's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=9,MAJORNUM=1)
 First-professional degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=10,MAJORNUM=1)
 First-professional certificates (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=11,MAJORNUM=1)

Total degrees and certificates is the sum of:
 Bachelor degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelors degree as defined above and 
 Associate's degrees (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=3,MAJORNUM=1)
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least two but less-than four academic years (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=4,MAJORNUM=1).
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least one but less-than two academic years (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=2,MAJORNUM=1); 
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year (CRACE24,AWLEVEL=1,MAJORNUM=1) 

4) Degree-granting,  Associate's and certificates - Institutions offer an Associate's degree (LEVEL3) and may offer other postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year (LEVEL1); at least one but less-than two academic years (LEVEL2); at least two but less-than four academic years (LEVEL4). (IC)

5) Nondegree-granting, above the baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's (LEVEL3), Bachelor's (LEVEL5), Master's (LEVEL7), Doctor's (LEVEL9) or First-professional (LEVEL10) degrees, but offer either Postbaccaulaureate (LEVEL6), Post-master's (LEVEL8) or First-professional (LEVEL11) certificates. (IC)

6) Nondegree-granting, sub-baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's (LEVEL3), Bachelor's (LEVEL5), Master's (LEVEL7), Doctor's (LEVEL9),  or  First-professional(LEVEL10) degrees, or certificates above the baccalaureate level(LEVEL6,LEVEL8 and LEVEL11). They do offer postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year (LEVEL1); at least one but less than two academic years (LEVEL2); or at least two but less than four academic years.(LEVEL4) (IC)

All inactive institutions (CYACTIVE in (2,3)) and administrative units (Sector=0) were coded as not applicable. Any institution that did not respond to the 2006-07 Institutional Characteristics component or the 2005-06 Completions component were coded as not reported or could not derive. These were all NonTitle IV institutions.

Additional notes on classifying Degree-granting primarily baccalaureate or above and other baccalaureate granting:

Degree-granting institutions whose completions data are reported with their parent institution were assigned the same code as the parent institution.
 
New degree-granting institutions that offer a bachelor's degree, but have not yet awarded bachelor degrees in academic year 2005-06 were assigned as follows:

  If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above (indicating the level was offered) and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above.
  
  If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's degree and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, other baccalaureate granting.
  
  For institutions that reported zeros for both bachelor's degrees or above and for levels below the bachelor's the number of programs (CIP codes) by level was used to determine the primary classification. If the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates at the bachelor's level or above was greater than the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates less than the baccalaureate, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, primarily bachelor's or above.  If the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates at the bachelor's level or above was less than the number of programs with reported zeros for degrees/certificates less than the baccalaureate, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, other baccalaureate granting."
HD2006,LANDGRNT,"Land Grant Institution

A land-grant college or university is an institution that has been designated by its state legislature or Congress to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. The original mission of these institutions, as set forth in the first Morrill Act, was to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies so that members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education. 

Over the years, land-grant status has implied several types of federal support. The first Morrill Act provided grants in the form of federal lands to each state for the establishment of a public institution to fulfill the act's provisions. At different times money was appropriated through legislation such as the second Morrill Act and the Bankhead-Jones Act, although the funding provisions of these acts are no longer in effect. Today, the Nelson Amendment to the Morrill Act provides a permanent annual appropriation of $50,000 per state and territory. 

A key component of the land-grant system is the agricultural experiment station program created by the Hatch Act of 1887. The Hatch Act authorized direct payment of federal grant funds to each state to establish an agricultural experiment station in connection with the land-grant institution there. The amount of this appropriation varies from year to year and is determined for each state through a formula based on the number of small farmers there. A major portion of the federal funds must be matched by the state. 

To disseminate information gleaned from the experiment stations' research, the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created a Cooperative Extension Service associated with each U.S. land-grant institution. This act authorized ongoing federal support for extension services, using a formula similar to the Hatch Act's to determine the amount of the appropriation. This act also requires that the states provide matching funds in order to receive the federal monies.


Passage of the First Morrill Act (1862) reflected a growing demand for agricultural and technical education in the United States. While a number of institutions had begun to expand upon the traditional classical curriculum, higher education was still widely unavailable to many agricultural and industrial workers. The Morrill Act was intended to provide a broad segment of the population with a practical education that had direct relevance to their daily lives.

The Second Morrill Act (1890) sought to extend access to higher education by providing additional endowments for all land-grants, but prohibiting distribution of money to states that made distinctions of race in admissions. However, states that provided a separate land-grant institution for blacks were eligible to receive the funds. The institutions that, as a result of this act, were founded or designated the land-grant for blacks in each of the then-segregated Southern states came to be known as ""the 1890 land-grants.""  Native American tribal colleges are sometimes called the ""1994 land-grants.""

"
HD2006,DFRCGID,"Data Feedback Report comparison group category. - This indicator was used to create the automatic comparison groups in the IPEDS Data Feedback Report/Executive Peer tool, when institutions did not provide their own comparison group.

This variable was derived using institutional control, Carnegie classification, highest level of offering, geographic region, program concentration and enrollment size. 

Institutions were first grouped by institutional control (public, private not-for-profit, and for-profit). Degree-granting institutions were then grouped by the 2005 Basic Carnegie classification. Large groups by control and carnegie were then divided by geographic region and/or enrollment size to create peer group sizes of approximately 30 to 35 institutions. Nondegree-granting institutions were classified by highest level of offering, program concentration and enrollment size.  

Comparison groups 167 through 169 is an example of a comparison group that is divided into 3 groupings ordered by size.

167 Masters Colleges & Universities (smaller programs), Not-for-profit/1 
168 Masters Colleges & Universities (smaller programs), Not-for-profit/2 
169 Masters Colleges & Universities (smaller programs), Not-for-profit/3 

Institutions that participate in Title IV Federal financial aid programs were classified and included in the Data Feedback report. Non-Title IV institutions were not classified and were coded as not applicable.

Some institutions including the U.S. Service schools and institutions in American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, Northern Marianas, Palau, and Virgin Islands could not be classified and were not sent Data FeedBack Reports. These schools are identified with codes of 901 or greater for the 2006 report."
