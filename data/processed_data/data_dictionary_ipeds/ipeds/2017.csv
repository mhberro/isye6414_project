HD2017,CONTROL,"A classification of whether an institution is operated by publicly elected or appointed officials or by privately elected or appointed officials and derives its major source of funds from private sources.

Public institution - An educational institution whose programs and activities are operated by publicly elected or appointed school officials and which is supported primarily by public funds. 

Private not-for-profit institution - A private institution in which the individual(s) or agency in control receives no compensation, other than wages, rent, or other expenses for the assumption of risk. These include both independent not-for-profit schools and those affiliated with a religious organization. 

Private for-profit institution - A private institution in which the individual(s) or agency in control receives compensation other than wages, rent, or other expenses for the assumption of risk. 



"
HD2017,HOSPITAL,"A code to indicate whether the institution has hospital.

This variable was derived using Finance data.

If institution reported either revenues from Sales and services of hospitals GASB, hospital revenues (FASB), or expenses for hospital services (GASB or FASB) an institution was determined to have a hospital.  See glossary terms below.


Sales and services of hospitals (revenues) F1B06-GASB.  Revenues (net of discounts, allowances, and provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable) generated by hospitals from daily patient, special and other services. Revenues of health clinics that are part of a hospital should be included in this category, unless such clinics are part of the student health services program. 

Hospitals (revenues) F2D13-FASB.  Revenues generated by a hospital operated by the postsecondary institution. Includes gifts, grants, appropriations, research revenues, endowment income, and revenues of health clinics that are part of the hospital unless such clinics are part of the student health services program. Sales and service revenues are included net of patient contractual allowances. Revenues associated with the medical school are included elsewhere. Also includes all amounts appropriated by governments (federal, state, local) for the operation of hospitals. 

Hospital services (F1C121-GASB, F2E091-FASB).  Expenses associated with a hospital operated by the postsecondary institution (but not as a component unit) and reported as a part of the institution. This classification includes nursing expenses, other professional services, general services, administrative services, and fiscal services. Also included are information technology expenses, actual or allocated costs for operation and maintenance of plant, and depreciation related to hospital capital assets. FASB institutions also charge or allocate interest expense to hospitals.

HD2017,RPTMTH,"Reporting method identifies how institutions report student charges (full academic year or by program)  and the type of cohort (fall or full-year) used to report graduation rate, retention rate and student financial aid data. 

Institutions with standard academic terms (semester, quarter, trimester or 4-1-4 - CALSYS in (1,2,3,4)) report student charges for the full academic year and report graduation rate, retention rate and student financial aid data for a FALL cohort.

Institutions with other academic calendar systems (CALYSYS=5) report student charges for the full academic year  and report graduation rate, retention rate and student financial aid for a FULL-YEAR cohort. Other academic year is a category used to describe ""non-traditional"" calendar systems at 4-year and 2-year degree-granting institutions. These can include schools that offer primarily on-line courses or ""one course at a time."" 

Institutions with calendar systems that differ by program or operate on a continuous basis (e.g., every 2 weeks, monthly or other period - CALSYS in (6,7)) report student charges by program for the entire length of program and report graduation rate, retention rate and student financial aid for a FULL-YEAR cohort.

ACADEMIC YEAR - The period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to 2 semesters or trimesters, 3 quarters, or the period covered by a 4-1-4 calendar system. 
FALL COHORT - The group of students entering in the fall term established for tracking purposes. For the Graduation Rates component, this includes all students who enter an institution as full-time, first-time degree or certificate-seeking undergraduate students during the fall term of a given year. 
FULL-YEAR COHORT - The group of students entering at any time during the 12-month period September 1 through August 31 that is established for tracking and reporting Graduation Rate (GRS) data for institutions that primarily offer occupational programs of varying lengths. Students must be full time and first time to be considered in the cohort."
HD2017,INSTCAT,"Institutional category was derived using the level of offerings reported on the Institutional Characteristics (IC) component and the number and level of awards that were reported on the Completions (C) component.

Category descriptions:

1) Degree-granting, graduate with no undergraduate degrees - These institutions offer a Master's degree, Doctor's degree  or a First-professional degree and do not offer a Bachelor's degree or an Associate's degree. 

2) Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above - These institutions offer a Bachelor's degree, Master's degree,Doctor's degree or a First-professional degree.  Also, the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded is greater than 50 percent. 

3) Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above - These institutions offer a Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, Doctor's degree,or a First-professional degree.  Also, the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded must be less than or equal to 50 percent.

4) Degree-granting, Associate's and certificates - Institutions offer an Associate's degree and may offer other postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year; at least one but less-than two academic years; at least two but less-than four academic years. This category also includes institutions that offer a postbaccalaureate certificate, Post-master's certificate or a First-professional certificate and the highest degree offered is an Associate's degree.

5) Nondegree-granting, above the baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, Doctor's or First-professional degrees, but offer either Postbaccaulaureate, Post-master's or First-professional certificates. 

6) Nondegree-granting, sub-baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's, Bachelor's , Master's, Doctor's, or First-professional degrees, or certificates above the baccalaureate level. They do offer postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year; at least one but less than two academic years; or at least two but less than four academic years.

Technical details for Institutional Category (INSTCAT):

Total degrees and certificates and total bachelor's degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree awarded are derived using data from the Completions component.

Total bachelor's degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree is the sum of: 

Bachelor's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=5,MAJORNUM=1)
Postbaccalaureate certificates (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=6,MAJORNUM=1)
Master's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=7,MAJORNUM=1)
Post-master's certificates (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=8,MAJORNUM=1)
Doctor's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=9,MAJORNUM=1)
First-professional degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=10,MAJORNUM=1)
First-professional certificates (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=11,MAJORNUM=1)

Total degrees and certificates is the sum of Bachelor degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelors degree as defined above added to the following:

Associate's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=3,MAJORNUM=1)
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least two but less-than four academic years 
   (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=4, MAJORNUM=1).
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least one but less-than two academic years
   (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=2,MAJORNUM=1); 
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year 
    (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=1,MAJORNUM=1) 

Institutions are classified as Degree-granting (DEGGRANT=1) or Nondegree-granting(DEGGRANT=2) using level of offerings data reported on the Institutional Characteristics component. Degree-granting institutions offer an Associate's (LEVEL3=1),Bachelor's (LEVEL5=1, Master's (LEVEL7=1), Doctoral (LEVEL9=1), or a First-Professional (LEVEL10=1) degree. Any institution that offers only certificates are Nondegree-granting.

Nondegree-granting institutions that offer a postbaccalaureate certificate (LEVEL6=1) or a post-master's certificate (LEVEL8=1) or a First-professional certificate (LEVEL11=1) are classified as Nondegree-granting, above the baccalaureate (INSTCAT=5).

Nondegree-granting institutions that only offer certificates of less-than four academic years are classified as Nondegree-granting, sub-baccalaureate (INSTCAT=6).

Degree-granting institutions whose highest degree granted are Associate's (HDEGOFFR=40) are classified as Degree-granting, Associate's and certificates (INSTCAT=4). (There are a few 4-year institutions that grant Postbaccalaureate or Post-master's or First-professional certificates in this category).

Degree-granting institutions that do not grant a Bachelor's degree (LEVEL5=0) and do not grant an Associate's degree (LEVEL3=0) are classified as Degree-granting, graduate with no undergraduate degrees (INSTCAT=1).

The remaining degree-granting institutions offer a bachelor's degree or an associate's degree, or both.
For these institutions a percent of bachelor's degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree of  total degrees and certificates is generated. If the percent is greater than 50, institutions are classified as Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above (INSTCAT=2), If the percent is 50 or less, institutions are classified as Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above (INSTCAT=3).

Inactive institutions (CYACTIVE in (2,3)) and administrative units (Sector=0) were coded as not applicable. All Non-Title IV institutions that did not respond to the  IC or Completions components were coded as not reported. 
Degree-granting institutions whose completions data are reported with their parent institution were assigned the same code as the parent institution.
New degree-granting institutions that report offering a bachelor's degree on the current institutional characteristics file for the upcoming academic year, and have not yet reported bachelor's degrees on the current completions that covers the previous academic year  June 1-July 30 were assigned as follows:

If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above (indicating the level was offered) and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above. If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's degree and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above.

For institutions that reported zeros for bachelor's degrees of above and for levels below the bachelor's, the maximum number of programs by level was used to determine the primary classification."
HD2017,LANDGRNT,"Land Grant Institution

A land-grant college or university is an institution that has been designated by its state legislature or Congress to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. The original mission of these institutions, as set forth in the first Morrill Act, was to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies so that members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education. 

Over the years, land-grant status has implied several types of federal support. The first Morrill Act provided grants in the form of federal lands to each state for the establishment of a public institution to fulfill the act's provisions. At different times money was appropriated through legislation such as the second Morrill Act and the Bankhead-Jones Act, although the funding provisions of these acts are no longer in effect. Today, the Nelson Amendment to the Morrill Act provides a permanent annual appropriation of $50,000 per state and territory. 

A key component of the land-grant system is the agricultural experiment station program created by the Hatch Act of 1887. The Hatch Act authorized direct payment of federal grant funds to each state to establish an agricultural experiment station in connection with the land-grant institution there. The amount of this appropriation varies from year to year and is determined for each state through a formula based on the number of small farmers there. A major portion of the federal funds must be matched by the state. 

To disseminate information gleaned from the experiment stations' research, the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created a Cooperative Extension Service associated with each U.S. land-grant institution. This act authorized ongoing federal support for extension services, using a formula similar to the Hatch Act's to determine the amount of the appropriation. This act also requires that the states provide matching funds in order to receive the federal monies.


Passage of the First Morrill Act (1862) reflected a growing demand for agricultural and technical education in the United States. While a number of institutions had begun to expand upon the traditional classical curriculum, higher education was still widely unavailable to many agricultural and industrial workers. The Morrill Act was intended to provide a broad segment of the population with a practical education that had direct relevance to their daily lives.

The Second Morrill Act (1890) sought to extend access to higher education by providing additional endowments for all land-grants, but prohibiting distribution of money to states that made distinctions of race in admissions. However, states that provided a separate land-grant institution for blacks were eligible to receive the funds. The institutions that, as a result of this act, were founded or designated the land-grant for blacks in each of the then-segregated Southern states came to be known as ""the 1890 land-grants.""  Native American tribal colleges are sometimes called the ""1994 land-grants.""

HD2017,DFRCGID,"Data Feedback Report comparison group category. - This indicator was used to create the automatic comparison groups in the IPEDS Data Feedback Report, when institutions did not provide their own comparison group. 

All institutions that participated in Title IV federal financial aid programs were first separated into degree-granting and nondegree-granting groups by control of institution (public, private, not-for-profit and private for-profit). 

Degree-granting institutions were divided into the following groups using the institution category variable: graduate and 4-year primarily baccalaureate and above; 4-year primarily associate's; and 2-year degree-granting. The Carnegie Classification Basic 2015 was then used further classify degree-granting institutions within the 4 groups. The highest degree offered was used for 4-year degree-granting institutions that did not have a carnegie classification. 

The majority of nondegree-granting institutions were grouped by their largest program. The largest program was based on the largest program identified by the cipcode, that the institution reported on the student cost section of the institutional characteristics component. The programs are business (52), communications and communication technologies(09,10), cosmetology(12.04), engineering and engineering technologies(14,15) , manufacturing, construction, repair, and transportation (46,47,48,49) and health (51). All other cipcodes were combined to for the other programs category. 

Communications and communication technologies, engineering and engineering technologies and, manufacturing, construction, repair, and transportation groups were added for the 2018 report. 

When the above methodolgy yielded small comparison groups (< 4 schools), groups of different controls maybe combined or a 4-year primarily associates maybe combined with a 4-year baccalaureate and above group. 

When the above methodology yielded large groups (greater than 40), groups were further subdivided by size, based on 12-month enrollment, (See cosmetology groups above). 

Special groups were made for the Tribal colleges, U.S. service institutions, and institutions in other jurisdictions, such as Puerto Rico.

In Prior data feedback reports Distance learning ""Only"" institutions were classified as one group. For the 2018 distance learning ""Only"" were classified based on their Carnegie Classification."
